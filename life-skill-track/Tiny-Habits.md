# Tiny Habits

### Question 1 In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
Understand the change we want, and break it down into tiny behaviors. Repeat these behaviors to make them habits.

### Question 2 How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?
The famous formula given by BJ Fogg is <br/>
**B = MAP**, where <br/>
B = Behaviour  <br/>
M = Motivation <br/>
A = Ability    <br/>
P = Prompt     <br/>

We can use this formula to 
 * Break down any wanted behavior or habits into tiny habits.
 * Give action prompt i.e. link our tiny habits with some other daily tasks. This provides the stimuli and helps in maintaining continuity.
 * Celebrate our small wins. By doing so we increase our motivation to do other tasks.

### Question 3 Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?
The reason for celebrations is to motivate ourselves every time we complete a habit.<br/>
Whatever we celebrate becomes our habit. We need to celebrate the right habits irrespective of their size/importance to motivate ourselves.

### Question 4 In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
A simple improvement/change every day has a compounding effect over a long period. Instead of trying to achieve something suddenly, break it down into smaller goals. Work on them continuously and celebrate them.

### Question 5 What is the book's perspective about Identity?
Identity is at the core of any person's behavior. Identity can also be explained as the type of person we believe we are. To create new habits or change behavior, it is best to do so from the core i.e. we first need to set what kind of person we want to be. Then, we practice our atomic habits daily.<br/>

### Question 6 Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.
Below are some ways to make a habit easier to do :
 * Make it obvious: create cues (stimuli) that make us aware of it. This can be done using charts, scorecard applications...etc.
 * Make it attractive: create activities/tasks more attractive to the human brain to do. Some ways are listening to music or audiobooks.
 * Make it easy: here we aim to reduce the efforts required for us to do any task. This can be done by keeping the required resources nearby.
 * Make it satisfying: enjoying the process or related process can help while we are doing tasks/habits.

### Question 7 Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.
We can make a habit harder to do by simply doing the opposite of the previous answers i.e<br> 
 * Hide cues: hide objects/notifications that stimulate us to do habits we want to avoid.
 * Make it fugly: we can intentionally make the habits unattractive/fugly.
 * Make it hard: create intentional obstacles in our tasks/habits
 * Make it unsatisfying: simply, avoid taking joy out of the actions/habits.  


### Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
One habit I would like to do more of is "Eating more fruits". I would take the following steps:<br/> 

 * Buy fruits and keep them nearby by the study table, directly visible to me.
 * Make small sticky notes reminders to eat fruits in the evening
 * Enjoy the taste while consuming them.


### Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
One habit I would like to eliminate or do less of is "Giving too much time to optimizing a solution". I would take the following steps: <br/>

* Once a solution to a problem is achieved, I would set the remainder to limit my time spent on optimizing it.
* Close the machine/laptop and do other tasks.
